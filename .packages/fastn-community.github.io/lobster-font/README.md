# Lobster : FASTN Font Package

This repository contains a [fastn font package](https://fpm.dev/featured/fonts/) containing [Google Font: 
Lobster](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lobster/about?query=Lobster).

The Lobster font took a different approach. The new OpenType format gives us the
possibility to have multiple versions of each letter, and that's exactly what
we are doing: Instead of compromising the design of our letters to force
connections, we do what lettering artist do. We draw many versions of each
letter and a lot of different letter-pairs (aka "ligatures") so we always use
the best possible variation of each letter depending of the context of the
letter inside each word. All this happens automatically in any browser that
supports ligatures.

Designers: [Impallari Type](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Impallari%20Type), [Cyreal](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Cyreal)
